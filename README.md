## Data Analytics 
##### Professor Alex Pang - Queens College, City University of New York
- **DA_CarCrashes_MPG**
  - Used pandas library in order to load data from *car_crashes2.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Checked for and removed null values
  - Used seaborn library in order to assess for outliers using scatterplots and boxplots
  - Used pandasql library in order to query and calculate statistics (mean, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis) from dataset using both SQL and pandas functions
  - Used seaborn library in order to check accident distribution by region by plotting histograms
  - Used correlation function to check which attributes have the strongest affect on causing accidents
  - Used pandas library in order to load data from *mpg3.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Checked for missing values, imputed mean of attribute in place of missing values
  
- **DA_LinearLogisticRegression_HousingAffairs**
  - Used pandas library to load data from *USA_housing.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Used seaborn library to create pairplot in order to assess relationship between attributes using scatterplots
  - Used correlation function to check which attributes have the strongest affect on housing prices
  - Used sklearn library in order to generate a linear regression model fit with values from attributes sharing the highest correlation (*Income* and *Price*)
  - Used matplotlib pyplot library in order to plot predicted values of linear regression as a red line against scatterplot of actual data values
  - Used sklearn library and train_test_split function in order to
