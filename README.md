## Data Analytics 
##### Professor Alex Pang - Queens College, City University of New York
- **DA_CarCrashes_MPG**
  - Used pandas library in order to load data from *car_crashes2.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Checked for and removed null values
  - Used seaborn library in order to assess for outliers using scatterplots and boxplots
  - Used pandasql library in order to query and calculate statistics (mean, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis) from dataset using both SQL and pandas functions
  - Used seaborn library in order to check accident distribution by region by plotting histograms
  - Used correlation function to check which attributes have the strongest affect on causing accidents
  - Used pandas library in order to load data from *mpg3.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Checked for missing values, imputed mean of attribute in place of missing values
  
- **DA_LinearLogisticRegression_HousingAffairs**
  - Used pandas library to load data from *USA_housing.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Used seaborn library to create pairplot in order to assess relationship between attributes using scatterplots
  - Used correlation function to check which attributes have the strongest affect on housing prices
  - Used sklearn library in order to generate a linear regression model fit with values from attributes sharing the highest correlation (*Income* and *Price*)
  - Used matplotlib pyplot library in order to plot predicted values of linear regression as a red line against scatterplot of actual data values
  - Used sklearn library with train_test_split function in order to train a new linear regression model, and test its ability to make predicitons on 20% of the training data from the previous attributes.
  - Used k-fold cross validation in order to test skill of the models. 
  - Used pandas library to load data from *affairs2.csv* dataset into dataframe
  - Used seaborn library in order to generate heatmap of data to check for rows with missing values, and generate factor plots to compare the significance of attributes
  - Used sklearn library with train_test_split function in order to train a linear regression model using select attributes from dataset
  - Used pandas library with one-hot encoding/get_dummies function in order to convert categorical data ('Occupation') into numerical data and include in training set of linear regression model
  - Used sklearn library with classification_report and accuracy_score functions in order to generate performance metrics of the prediction models.

- **DA_SVM_DecTrees_Affairs**
  - Used pandas library in order to load **affair2.csv** dataset into dataframe, one-hot encoding/get_dummies function to convert categorical data into numeric data,
